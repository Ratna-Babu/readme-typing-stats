Build a service that generates animated SVGs where text is typed out (like a typewriter effect), but instead of static lines, it uses live GitHub data (commits, stars, PRs, followers, etc.).

Anyone should be able to embed it in their README like:

<img src="https://your-service.com/typing?user=ratna-babu&type=commit" />


And it will display something like:

Latest commit: Fix bug in index.js

🏗️ System Architecture
1. Frontend (GitHub README user)

User just includes an <img> tag in their README.

Browser fetches SVG from your service.

2. Backend Service (Your App)

Written in Node.js/Express (or Python/FastAPI).

Handles requests like /typing?user=octocat&type=commit.

Does not return HTML → instead, it returns an SVG (Content-Type: image/svg+xml).

3. Data Layer

Two possible approaches:

🔹 A. API Fetching with Caching (MVP)

Fetch data from GitHub REST/GraphQL API.

Cache results for 10 minutes per user/repo in Redis, SQLite, or memory.

If multiple people request the same data, serve from cache (no extra GitHub calls).

This handles hundreds of users without hitting limits.

🔹 B. Pre-Generated JSON via GitHub Actions (Scalable for Many Users)

Each user sets up a GitHub Action in their repo (we provide template).

Action fetches GitHub data every hour/day and commits a data.json file.

Your service just reads this JSON and animates it.

✅ No API rate limits (GitHub Actions uses the user’s own token).

✅ Unlimited scale, since your service doesn’t talk to GitHub directly.

4. SVG Generator

Core logic that converts dynamic text (commit message, star count, etc.) into an animated typing SVG.

Uses <text>, <tspan>, <animate> inside SVG.

Options for customization:

color → text color

size → font size

cursor=true/false → show blinking cursor

repeat=true/false → loop animation

speed=50 → typing speed

🚀 Features
✅ Core Features

Fetch GitHub data dynamically:

Latest commit message

Star count

Fork count

Follower count

Pull request or issue stats

Animate text with typing + deleting effect.

Allow customization via query params (color, font, speed).

✨ Advanced Features

Multi-line typing (e.g., commit message → star count → followers → repeat).

Different animation styles (typing, fade-in, glitch effect, circular typing).

User themes (light/dark mode).

Support for other data sources (weather, quotes, etc.).

⚡ Example Use Cases

Developer Portfolio

Show live GitHub stats in README with animation:

"Latest commit: Add feature X"

"Repo Stars: 152"

Team Projects

Show last commit of a shared repo in the project README.

Open Source Attractiveness

Show star count with typing effect to make the project page engaging.

🛠️ Deployment
MVP

Deploy on Vercel/Render/Railway → easy to scale globally.

Add caching to avoid API rate limits.

Scalable Version

Encourage users to run a GitHub Action in their repo to generate data.json.

Your service just reads JSON and animates it → no rate limit issues, works for thousands of users.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User Workflow

User finds your project and wants dynamic typing in their README.

They copy an <img> link from your docs:

<img src="https://your-service.com/typing?user=octocat&type=commit" />


(Optional) If they want no limits, they set up your GitHub Action → generates data.json.

Your service reads the data, generates animated SVG, and GitHub renders it.

🌟 Why This Will Stand Out

It’s first-of-its-kind (no project currently combines live GitHub data with typing animation).

Developers love showing stats → you make it more engaging with animation.

Scalable (can serve many users with caching + Actions approach).
